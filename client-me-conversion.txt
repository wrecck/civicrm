Here’s a clean, battle-tested way to build what Joshua wants—so it works now and scales later.

The approach (MVP → Durable)
Phase 1 — Get a working MVP fast

Goal: post allocations/deliveries into an append-only Unit Transaction Ledger automatically.

Environment & data

Keep Dev in sync with Prod DB and the /sites/default/files/civicrm/ext directory.

In Dev, confirm the four deposit activity types exist:

Unit Allocation – Housing, FCS Housing Authorization

Unit Allocation – Employment, FCS Employment Authorization

Confirm custom groups/fields from his field-map PDF are present.

Posting rules (no code, quick)

Use CiviRules + APIv4 action:

Trigger: Activity is created for each of the 4 allocation types → write +units to the ledger.

Trigger: Activity is created for “Delivered Units” (or the activity types he uses for service time) → compute units from duration

Housing: 1 hr → 1 unit

Employment: 1 hr → 4 units
→ write −units to the ledger.

Use an idempotency check field (e.g., store source_activity_id in the ledger) to avoid duplicate posts if an activity is edited/saved twice.

Make the ledger append-only. Corrections = separate “adjustment” entries.

Operator views

Add a SearchKit view: running balance per Case (filters: program, date, staff).

Optional: a simple “Ledger” tab on the Case (Navigation Menu or FormBuilder display).

This gets everyone transacting and seeing balances quickly.

Phase 2 — Make it durable & maintainable (small custom extension)

Replace the CiviRules glue with a lightweight CiviCRM extension so all logic lives in one place.

Key parts

Event listeners / hooks: listen to Activity create (and optionally update) using APIv4 Entity Hooks or hook_civicrm_post.

Posting engine (service class):

Maps activity type → program (Housing/Employment) and direction (+/−).

Calculates units (configurable multipliers, default 1 and 4).

Writes one ledger row with: case_id, contact_id, program, entry_type, units_delta, balance_after, activity_id, created_by, created_date.

Enforces idempotency (unique index on activity_id + entry_type).

Config UI:

Map activity types to ledger “entry types”.

Set unit multipliers per program (so admin can change 1↔4 without code).

Recompute tool:

Button to “Rebuild balances” for a case/date range if historical data changes.

Permissions & audit:

“View Ledger”, “Post Adjustment”, “Recompute” roles.

Log who/when posted each entry (already in ledger row).

Reports:

SearchKit datasets for exports (monthly billing, by staff, by program).

Tests:

Unit tests for the posting engine (math, idempotency, mapping).

Why an extension? Fewer moving pieces than many CiviRules, easier debugging, version-controlled, safer for imports/replays.

CSV Intake (State authorizations)

Add an importer that turns the state CSV into Authorization activities (and thus deposits).

Dry-run preview with validation (required columns, duplicates).

Map CSV → the exact machine-name fields from Joshua’s spreadsheet/PDF.

Batch/queue the import (no timeouts), and rely on the same posting engine to write the deposit rows.

Produce an import report (success, warnings, rejects) that can be downloaded.

Data model choices

If the Unit Transaction Ledger already exists as a custom entity, use it.
Otherwise, create a dedicated table (simpler & faster than custom fields), indexed by case_id, activity_id, created_date.

Rollout plan

Finish Dev/Local parity (DB + /files/civicrm/ext).

MVP with CiviRules (hours, not days) so staff can start using the process and you can validate flows.

Build the extension (posting engine + config + recompute).

Replace CiviRules with the extension rules, keep CiviRules disabled as a fallback.

Add CSV importer, then reports.

Promote to Prod with a small deployment checklist (DB backup, extension enable, cache clear, extension config import).

Open items to confirm (so we encode them correctly)

Exact activity types used for deductions (“Delivered”) and where time is stored (duration or custom field).

Whether edits to an Authorization/Delivered activity should:

create an adjustment entry, or

recompute and replace prior entries.

Edge cases: reversals, negative allocations, back-dated entries, and cross-program transfers (if any).

TL;DR

Start: CiviRules + APIv4 for quick automatic ledger posts.

Then: a small CiviCRM extension that centralizes the math, mappings, idempotency, and recomputes.

Add a CSV importer that creates Authorization activities (deposits) and reuse the same posting engine.

Provide SearchKit views and a Case “Ledger” tab so staff see balances instantly.

If you want, I’ll scaffold the extension (directory, info.xml, hook stubs, a PostingService, and a basic config screen) so you can drop it into sites/default/files/civicrm/ext and iterate.

im still not able to successfully copy the dev server to my local.  whats my best(realistic) options
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 12s

Totally get it—you’ve wrestled with scp/rsync enough. Here are the three most reliable ways to get a working local copy, in order of “least pain → most control.” Pick one and run with it.

1) WinSCP “Synchronize” (GUI, resume-safe) — Easiest

WinSCP handles flaky connections, resumes automatically, and can mirror folders.

Steps

Install WinSCP on Windows.

New Session

File protocol: SFTP

Host name: 192.168.101.102 (Dev)

User: ubuntu (your SSH user)

Connect → approve host key.

In the right pane, browse to these on Dev (left pane = local):

/home/ubuntu/drupal-site/

/home/ubuntu/modules/

/var/www/web/sites/default/files/civicrm/ext/

DB dump (create one if needed, see #3 below): /home/ubuntu/dev-civicrmdb.sql

For each folder, right-click → Synchronize…

Direction: Remote → Local

Mode: Mirror

Options: ✔ “Delete files” (if you want exact mirror), ✔ “Preview changes”, ✔ “Use temporary files for transfer”

Let it run. If it drops, just reconnect—WinSCP resumes where it left off.

This is usually the fastest path to success on Windows because it avoids path quirks and gives you a visual diff.

2) One tarball per area + download — Most reliable on shaky links

Avoid transferring thousands of tiny files. Make 3–4 archives on Dev, then grab those single files.

On Dev (SSH):

cd /home/ubuntu

# Codebase (composer project)
tar -czf drupal-site.tgz drupal-site

# Custom modules (if you have a top-level modules dir)
tar -czf modules.tgz modules

# CiviCRM extensions (the missing-extensions errors)
tar -czf civicrm-ext.tgz -C /var/www/web/sites/default/files/civicrm ext

# Fresh DB dump
mysqldump -u root -p civicrmdb > dev-civicrmdb.sql


On Windows (PowerShell):

scp ubuntu@192.168.101.102:/home/ubuntu/drupal-site.tgz C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\
scp ubuntu@192.168.101.102:/home/ubuntu/modules.tgz C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\
scp ubuntu@192.168.101.102:/home/ubuntu/civicrm-ext.tgz C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\
scp ubuntu@192.168.101.102:/home/ubuntu/dev-civicrmdb.sql C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\


Extract locally:

tar -xzf C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\drupal-site.tgz -C C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\
tar -xzf C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\modules.tgz -C C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\
tar -xzf C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\civicrm-ext.tgz -C C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\


Move ext into:
C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\drupal-site\web\sites\default\files\civicrm\ext\

If the link is really unstable, split the tar before copying:

split -b 500M drupal-site.tgz drupal-site.tgz.part-


Then scp the parts and reassemble locally:

copy /b drupal-site.tgz.part-* drupal-site.tgz

3) Rebuild code with Composer, copy only what’s unique — Smallest download

If you don’t need to copy Drupal core/vendor, you can recreate them locally and only pull the unique bits.

Locally (in C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\)

composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-site
cd drupal-site
# Add CiviCRM (adjust if project uses specific versions)
composer require civicrm/civicrm-core civicrm/civicrm-Drupal-8


Then copy down (with WinSCP or scp):

/var/www/web/sites/default/files/civicrm/ext/ → to local drupal-site/web/sites/default/files/civicrm/ext/

/home/ubuntu/modules/ → to local C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\modules\ (if they use a top-level modules dir)

Fresh DB dump (dev-civicrmdb.sql)

This avoids transferring vendor/ and core/ entirely.

After the files arrive (for any option)

Create DB & import:

"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE civicrmdb_local CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p civicrmdb_local < C:\xampp\htdocs\projects\onlygod\dev-civicrmdb.sql


Drupal settings (local):

Copy drupal-site\web\sites\default\default.settings.php → settings.php

Add DB block for civicrmdb_local (user root, pw your local).

CiviCRM settings:

Ensure drupal-site\web\sites\default\civicrm.settings.php exists.

Update DSN & paths:

define('CIVICRM_DSN','mysql://root:YOURPWD@127.0.0.1/civicrmdb_local?new_link=true');
define('CIVICRM_TEMPLATE_COMPILEDIR','C:/xampp/htdocs/projects/onlygod/drupal-site/web/sites/default/files/civicrm/templates_c');
define('CIVICRM_UF_BASEURL','http://localhost/projects/onlygod/drupal-site/web/');


Clear caches:

In UI: Administer → System Settings → Cleanup Caches and Update Paths

or vendor\bin\drush cr (if you installed drush locally)

Which should you choose?

WinSCP Synchronize — best “it just works” option on Windows with resume.

Tar+download — most reliable on unstable links; minimal SSH fuss.

Composer rebuild — smallest transfer; great if you’re comfortable with Composer.

If you want, I can give you a WinSCP session profile screenshot-style checklist (host, user, SFTP, saved site, synchronize options) so you can click through it in a minute.

Here’s the clean way to tackle what Joshua’s asking for, based on his docs and emails:

What to build (scope)

Unit Transaction Ledger (append-only) to track allocations, deliveries, and adjustments per case/client, with fields like case_id, contact_id, program_type, entry_type, units_delta, entry_datetime, and running balance_after. 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

Activity-driven posting rules

On FCS Housing/Employment Authorization activity creation → write +units (Benefit Limitation) to ledger.

On Delivered Units activity creation → compute units from duration×conversion (Housing: 1h=1u; Employment: 1h=4u) → write −units.

“Legacy Allocations” activity types remain for manual ± adjustments. 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

Use the existing custom field groups/activity types he set up (IDs in doc) so you’re posting from the right places:
Housing/Employment Units Allocated (gid 39/40), FCS Housing/Employment Authorization (gid 48/47), Housing/Employment Units Delivered (gid 37/38).

Recommended approach (how)

Phase 1 – Extension + data model

Create a small CiviCRM custom extension (e.g., org.onlygod.unitledger):

Install script creates a unit_ledger table and exposes an APIv4 entity (UnitLedger) with the fields from the “Ledger Field Map.”

Keep it append-only; corrections are new adjustment rows.

Phase 2 – Posting automation
2. Start fast with CiviRules:

Rule A: On create of FCS Housing Auth / FCS Employment Auth → APIv4 action to create UnitLedger row (+units).

Rule B: On create of Units Delivered (Housing/Employment) → compute units using the conversion (1:1, 1:4) and post −units.

Rule C: On create of Legacy Allocations → post ±units.

If you hit rule limits, move the logic into your extension using hook_civicrm_post to do the same API write.

Phase 3 – CSV → Activities
3. Build a simple importer (admin UI in the extension) that ingests the state’s authorization CSV and creates the correct Authorization activities with the mapped custom fields (e.g., Benefit Limitation, Auth dates, ProviderOne, etc.). Posting to the ledger then happens via the rules above.

Phase 4 – UX & reporting
4. Add a Case tab (“Units Ledger”) that lists entries + current balance and quick links to source Activities. Fields come directly from the Ledger map (case, contact, program type, entry type, units, timestamps).

5. Provide a summary report (by case, by program, date range) using a saved search or a small APIv4-backed report in the extension.

Perfect—after reading the files you sent, here’s the tight, updated plan for building what Joshua wants.

What we’re building

An append-only Unit Transaction Ledger tied to cases that records allocations, deliveries, and adjustments, with running balances. 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

Posting rules driven by Activities:

Authorization (FCS Housing/Employment) → post +units (Benefit Limitation) to the ledger.

How we’ll build it

CiviCRM Extension (custom module)

Create a small extension (e.g., org.onlygod.unitledger) that installs a custom entity/table for the ledger and exposes it via APIv4; keep it append-only (corrections are new adjustment rows). 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

Automation (fastest path first)

Start with CiviRules: on Activity create → call APIv4 to write the proper ledger row (allocation/delivery/adjustment). If we hit limits, we’ll move the logic into hook_civicrm_post inside the extension. 

Civi Crm Unit Billing – Field M…

Use the exact activity types / custom groups already defined (gids 37, 38, 39, 40, 47, 48) so we post from the right fields.

CSV → Authorization Activities (importer)

Build a simple importer screen that ingests the state’s CSV and creates the FCS Authorization activities populated with mapped fields (e.g., ProviderOne, Benefit Limitation, Auth Start/End). The ledger posts automatically via the rule above.

User interface

Case tab: “Units Ledger” listing entries and balance with links back to source Activities. (Fields per ledger map above.)

ChatGPT said:

Not four options—one plan in four parts:

Ledger extension (small custom module) → creates the ledger table/API.

Automation → start with CiviRules to write ledger rows on Activity create; later we can move that logic into the extension for durability.

CSV importer → turns the state CSV into Authorization activities (which then auto-post to the ledger).

UI → a Case “Units Ledger” tab + reports.

The only real “choice” is how to automate (CiviRules first vs. code). Everything else is additive.

Subject: Proposal for the units ledger & workflow

Hi Joshua,

I went through your emails, the field-map PDF, and the sample CSV. Here’s the plan I’m proposing:

Small CiviCRM extension (e.g. org.onlygod.unitledger)

Create an append-only Unit Ledger (table + APIv4).

Corrections aren’t edits—just new “adjustment” rows, so we keep a clean audit trail.

Automation (fastest first)

Start with CiviRules to post ledger entries when Activities are created:
• FCS Housing/Employment Authorization → deposit (+units, pulls Benefit Limitation).
• Units Delivered (Housing/Employment) → deduct based on duration (Housing 1hr=1 unit; Employment 1hr=4 units).
• Unit Allocation – Housing/Employment → manual ± adjustments.

If rules hit limits, I’ll move the logic into the extension (APIv4 / hook_civicrm_post) for durability.

CSV → Authorization Activities (importer)

Simple admin screen to upload the state CSV.

It creates the FCS Authorization activities with the mapped machine-name fields.

Those activity creates will auto-post to the ledger via the rules above.

UI

Add a “Units Ledger” tab on the Case showing running balance + links to source Activities.

A couple SearchKit reports (by case/program/date range). Keep it simple first.

Setup / assumptions

I’ll sync Dev with the latest Prod DB + /sites/default/files/civicrm/ext so I’m working against your newest activity types & custom groups.

Units math: Housing 1hr=1 unit; Employment 1hr=4 units (I can make this configurable if you want).

What I need from you

green light on this approach,

any edge cases I should bake in (reversals, back-dated edits, partial allocations),

a “good” sample CSV that represents typical authorizations,

confirm you’re OK with append-only ledger (corrections via adjustment entries).

I’ll start with the rules + basic ledger first, then layer in the importer and UI. If you want anything changed before I dive in, just let me know.

Thanks,
Derick

Subject: Plan for the units ledger & workflow

Hi Joshua,

After messing around in CiviCRM a bit and digging through the field map + the sample CSV, I think I’ve got a pretty clear path. In short, I’ll build a small custom extension for an append-only Unit Ledger, wire the first pass of automation with CiviRules (faster to ship), then move the rules into the extension if we need tighter control. I’ll also add a simple CSV upload that creates the FCS Authorization activities (so deposits post automatically), and a Case tab to show the running balance with links back to the source activities.

More concretely: I’ll start by syncing Dev with the latest Prod DB and the /files/civicrm/ext stuff, then confirm the new activity types and custom groups you set up. Authorizations will post +units into the ledger; Delivered Units will post –units based on time (Housing 1hr=1, Employment 1hr=4). The ledger stays append-only—any corrections are new adjustment rows, so we keep a clean audit trail. I’ll keep the UI simple to start (one ledger tab + a couple SearchKit views), then we can grow it.

If you’re good with that plan, I’ll get rolling. If there’s any edge cases I should bake in (reversals, back-dated edits, partial allocations, etc), just shoot them over. Also, quick thumbs-up that the unit math (1↔4) is correct, and I’ll make it configurable later so we’re not hard-coding it.

Yes. In his Field Map & Ledger Write Rules (Dev Hand-Off) doc, the “Unit Transaction Ledger” is explicitly described as an append-only ledger and the “Next steps” section says to keep it append-only; corrections = new adjustment row.

You said:
how is the CSV importer created specifically?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 27s

Great—here’s exactly how I’d build the CSV importer so it fits your setup and triggers deposits automatically.

Where it lives

Inside your custom extension (e.g., org.onlygod.unitledger/).

ext/org.onlygod.unitledger/
  info.xml
  unitledger.php
  CRM/Unitledger/Importer/FcsAuthorization.php
  CRM/Unitledger/BAO/UnitLedger.php            # (your ledger engine if you add one)
  Civi/Api4/UnitLedger.php                     # (if you expose a custom API)
  templates/Unitledger/Importer/FcsAuthorization.tpl


Add an admin menu item:

Location: Administer → CiviCRM → Unit Ledger → Import FCS Authorizations

URL: civicrm/unitledger/import/fcs-auth

The UI (simple)

An HTML/PHP form (or a FormBuilder/Afform if you prefer) with:

File upload (CSV)

Program: Housing or Employment (optional if you auto-detect)

Date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY)

“Dry-run only” checkbox

Duplicate policy: Skip / Update / Create new

Submit

Parsing & validation

Use a robust CSV reader (Composer dep):
league/csv (tiny, reliable)

composer require league/csv


Validation checks per row:

Required columns present (per your field map PDF).

Dates parseable.

Units (Benefit Limitation) numeric.

Contact resolvable (e.g., by ProviderOne or another unique key you store on the Contact).

Case resolvable (active case of the right Case Type: Housing or Employment).

If any check fails in Dry-run, show a preview table with errors; no writes happen.

Matching logic

For each CSV row:

Find Contact

Example: look up by ProviderOne ID stored in a Contact custom field.

If multiple matches or none → flag error (or allow configurable fallback).

Find Case

Find the open Case for that Contact of the correct program (Housing / Employment).

If multiple or none → flag error (or configurable behavior).

Idempotency

Compute a stable import hash (e.g., SHA1 of [ProviderOne, Program, AuthStart, AuthEnd, BenefitLimitation]).

Store it in a custom field on the Authorization activity (or use external_identifier if you prefer).

If an activity with the same hash already exists → follow Duplicate policy (Skip/Update/Create new).

Create the Authorization Activity

Use APIv4 to create the activity and link it to the case. Fill machine-name custom fields exactly as in the field-map doc (Benefit Limitation, Authorization Start/End, etc.). Example (PHP, simplified):

use Civi\Api4\Activity;

$activity = Activity::create()
  ->addValue('activity_type_id:name', $program === 'Housing'
      ? 'FCS Housing Authorization'
      : 'FCS Employment Authorization')

Note: In APIv4 you can reference fields as custom.<group_machine_name>.<field_machine_name> (much easier than numeric custom_XX). Use the machine names from Joshua’s PDF.

Posting to the ledger

You already set automation to post deposits when Authorization activities are created. Two ways:

Phase 1 (fast): CiviRules

Trigger: Activity is created for FCS Housing Authorization and FCS Employment Authorization.

Action: APIv4 UnitLedger.create (or your posting service) with +units.

Include activity_id, case_id, contact_id, program, units_delta, and compute the new balance.

Phase 2 (durable): in the extension

Implement hook_civicrm_post or APIv4 entity events for Activity.create → call your posting service.

Enforce idempotency (unique on activity_id + entry_type) so re-imports or edits don’t double-post.

Batch/queue & progress

Use CRM_Queue to process rows in chunks (e.g., 100 at a time).

Show a progress bar and a final result report:

Imported count, skipped, updated, errors.

Downloadable CSV of failures with messages.

Error handling & logs

Write a log file under sites/default/files/civicrm/ConfigAndLog/unit_import_YYYYMMDD.log.

Return a downloadable “errors.csv” with the original row + reason.

Permissions

New permission like “administer unit imports”.

Only admins can run it.

Testing

Dry-run on a small sample CSV (the example he sent).

Verify that the Authorization activity is created with correct custom fields.

Confirm CiviRules (or your hook) posts +units into the ledger.

Check the Case “Units Ledger” tab shows the deposit and correct running balance.

Command-line alternative (optional)

Provide a CLI entry point so you can:

cv ev "CRM_Unitledger_Importer_FcsAuthorization::import('/path/to/file.csv', ['program' => 'Housing', 'dryRun' => FALSE]);"


Nice for large files or cron-based automation.

TL;DR (your talking points)

A small admin page in our extension uploads the CSV, validates rows, and for each valid line creates the Authorization activity with the right machine-name fields.

That creation event triggers the deposit into the ledger (CiviRules first, extension logic later).

The importer is idempotent via an import hash; it supports dry-run, duplicate policy, and gives a result CSV of any errors.

If you want, I can generate the exact list of CSV→field mappings from the PDF so the importer’s column headings are locked in (and we’ll accept aliases in case the state tweaks headers).

no just a short answer, its going to be an extension as well?
ChatGPT said:

Yes—keep it inside the same custom CiviCRM extension as the ledger. That way the CSV upload, field mapping, and the auto-deposit posting logic all live together (clean, versioned, and easy to deploy).

Subject: Plan for the units ledger & workflow

Hi Joshua,

After messing around in CiviCRM a bit and digging through the field map + sample CSV, I think I’ve got a clear path. Here’s what I’m proposing:

Build a small CiviCRM extension for an append-only Unit Ledger (as per your document/requirement).

Do the first pass of automation with CiviRules to post deposits/deductions when activities are created (can move the logic into the extension later if we need).

Add a CSV importer inside the same extension that creates the FCS Authorization activities so deposits happen automatically.

Add a simple UI: a Case “Units Ledger” tab and a couple basic reports.

I’m gonna start by syncing Dev with the latest Prod DB and extensions, then wire this up. Units math I’m using is Housing 1hr=1, Employment 1hr=4 (as per your document/requirement). Ledger stays append-only—corrections are new adjustment rows (per the doc).

If that sounds good, I’ll get rolling. If there’s any edge cases I should bake in (reversals, back-dated edits, partial allocations), just let me know.

Thanks,
Derick

short answer, how do you do this? with code/via extension? where
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 26s

Short answer:
With code, inside the same custom CiviCRM extension.

Case “Units Ledger” tab: implement hook_civicrm_tabset('caseView', …) in the extension to add a tab pointing to a custom route like civicrm/unitledger/case?case_id=123. Register the route via a menu XML, and serve it with a page class (e.g., CRM/Unitledger/Page/CaseLedger.php) that renders a SearchKit display (ledger rows + running balance).

Reports: ship SearchKit SavedSearch + SearchDisplay as managed entities in the extension (e.g., via .mgd.php), and optionally add nav links with hook_civicrm_navigationMenu.

Where (paths):
ext/org.onlygod.unitledger/CRM/Unitledger/Page/CaseLedger.php
ext/org.onlygod.unitledger/xml/Menu/unitledger.xml
ext/org.onlygod.unitledger/*managed*.mgd.php

ChatGPT said:

He didn’t tell you to use CiviRules first; he said he’s open to any approach and explicitly listed options: “CiviRules? A Custom Module? External Code? I trust your opinion on this…” That line is in his follow-up email that included the field-map PDF and the sample spreadsheet.

So proposing “first pass with CiviRules, then move logic into code inside the extension if needed” is your plan, not his directive. It fits his openness: CiviRules gets a working flow quickly (on activity create → post to ledger), and moving it into the extension later makes it more robust, testable, and versioned once requirements settle.

You said:
all good. I sent the email and here is Joshua's response:
Hi Derick

 

Based on what you’ve sent below, it sounds like you understand what we are attempting to accomplish so I’m certainly ready to proceed.

I’m all for CiviRules actually, because its an area that I can easily modify later if necessary. The issue I was running into when using CiviRules is that it didn’t give me the ability to create actions that would post to the custom entity that I created to house the “ledger”.

 

I think that if you start there, using “Action Provider” to create additional “actions” for CiviRules and / or Form Processor, we could pretty easily build this out in CiviRules.

My only concern with CiviRules is that there must be a “Trigger”  that initiates the particular rule. So, lets say we have everything working where an activity is created under a case, the case manager enters all the details, including “Units Delivered”. They save the “Activity” and then realize they entered the wrong number of “units delivered”, so they go back in and correct the number. Well, in this case, there would no longer be a “NEW” activity being created, so if the CiviRules configuration is setup to copy units delivered To the ledger, whenever a new case activity is created, then that rule would not trigger and ultimately wouldn’t update the ledger.

I’m open to working around this by making sure to create various triggers such as Activity Create, Modify, Delete… BUT, I think we would be much better situated if the records were in some way directly linked… So, when a case activity is created and there are units allocated or delivered, that the data is directly linked to the ledger… I don’t even know if that’s possible, I just want to make sure there is no way that the ledger isn’t up to date at all times.

 

Since I’m not a developer, I wasn’t sure how best to explain what I’m attempting to say, so I asked Chat GPT to help me outline what I’m saying… I’ve attached that in a document… I’ve used ChatGPT A LOT in the development of the CRM, so it knows all of the in’s and out’s of everything I’ve done to setup the CRM. I’m wondering if there’s some way that I can give you access to it, so that you can see all the history and if you have questions, you could ask it how something was setup… I’ll look into that.

 

I’ve attached the document here, please check it out… I think it does a good job explaining why “trigger” based tracking, might not be the best approach… Of course, I trust your opinion  on this.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Here’s a reply you can send:

Subject: Re: CiviRules + direct linking for the ledger

Hi Joshua,

Thanks — I’m aligned with using CiviRules. To handle your concern about edits/deletes and keep the ledger always correct, I’ll ship a small custom extension that adds an Action Provider action (e.g. UnitLedger.postDelta). Then we’ll wire CiviRules to call that action on Activity create / update / delete.

The action will link each ledger row to the source activity id, and track a small “last_posted_units” value on the activity (hidden custom field). On create, it posts +units (auth) or −units (delivered). On update, it calculates the delta (new_units − last_posted_units) and appends an adjustment row (append-only). On delete, it posts the reverse of last_posted_units. That way the ledger stays accurate and directly tied to the activity, not just one-time triggers.

I’ll also add a Recompute tool (admin button) that rebuilds a case’s balance from activities, so even if anything drifts, we can guarantee correctness with one click. If you’re good with this plan, I’ll start on the Action Provider action + rules in Dev and we can test the edit/delete flows together. If you prefer we only post on certain statuses (e.g., when an activity is set to “Completed”), I can do that too.

Thanks,
Derick

Totally fair concern. A create-only rule wouldn’t catch edits—but we won’t do that. In CiviRules we’ll add three triggers for the same action: Activity Created, Activity Updated, and Activity Deleted (scoped to the relevant activity types). The action will be a small Action Provider method (in our extension) that’s delta-aware and linked to the source activity: we store a hidden “last_posted_units” on the activity and write ledger rows referencing that activity’s ID.

Create: post +/− units and set last_posted_units.

Update: if units changed, post the difference (new − last_posted) as an adjustment, then update last_posted_units.

Delete: post the reverse of last_posted_units to zero it out.

We’ll also guard with conditions (e.g., only when Status = Completed, only when the units field actually changed) to avoid double posts, and include a Recompute admin tool that rebuilds balances from activities if anything ever drifts.

You said:

can you show how to do this step by step or at least set up/show these triggers in my dev civicrm site
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 23s

Absolutely—here’s a tight, copy-paste walkthrough to set up the three CiviRules triggers (Create / Update / Delete) for your Activities on your Dev site.

Prereqs (one time)

Enable extensions: CiviRules and Action Provider (Administer → System Settings → Extensions).

(Optional but recommended) Add an Activity custom field last_posted_units in a hidden group “Unit Ledger Meta” (Administer → Customize Data & Screens → Custom Fields → Add Set → Used for: Activity → Add Integer field last_posted_units).

If our custom action isn’t installed yet, pick any temporary action (e.g., “Write to log”) so you can see the triggers fire. We’ll swap in the real action later.

A. Authorization deposits (FCS Housing/Employment Authorization)

Go to Administer → Automation → CiviRules → New Rule

Title: Auth Deposit – CREATE

Event: Activity is created

Conditions:

Activity Type in → FCS Housing Authorization, FCS Employment Authorization

(Optional) Activity Status = Completed

Action: (When our action is installed) UnitLedger: Post Delta with parameters:

Entry type: deposit

Program: Auto from Activity Type (or select)

Units source: Benefit Limitation (the machine-name field from the FCS Authorization group)

Duplicate the rule twice:

Auth Deposit – UPDATE → Event: Activity is updated (same conditions/action)

Auth Deposit – DELETE → Event: Activity is deleted (same conditions/action)

B. Delivered deductions (Units Delivered – Housing/Employment)

New Rule

Title: Delivered – CREATE

Event: Activity is created

Conditions:

Activity Type in → Housing Units Delivered, Employment Units Delivered (use your exact type names)

(Optional) Status = Completed

Action: UnitLedger: Post Delta

Entry type: delivery

Program: Auto from Activity Type

Units source: Duration × Multiplier (Housing = 1, Employment = 4) (the action will do the math; or pass program and let the action compute)

Duplicate twice:

Delivered – UPDATE → Event: Activity is updated

Delivered – DELETE → Event: Activity is deleted

How the three triggers keep the ledger correct

CREATE: posts +/− units and stores last_posted_units on the activity.

UPDATE: compares the new units to last_posted_units, posts the difference (adjustment), then updates last_posted_units.

DELETE: posts the reverse of last_posted_units to zero it out.

Quick test

Create an FCS Authorization → you should see a deposit appear in the ledger.

Create a Delivered activity for 2 hours (Housing) → ledger shows −2.

Edit that activity to 5 hours → ledger adds −3 adjustment.

Delete the activity → ledger adds +5 reversal.

If you want, I can give you the exact labels you’ll see for Action Provider once I push the UnitLedger: Post Delta action; until then, use a temporary action (e.g., “Write to log / Send email”) to verify the Create/Update/Delete triggers are firing.
